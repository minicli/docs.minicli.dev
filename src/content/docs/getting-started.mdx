This lesson gets a fresh miniCLI app running so every next lesson is hands-on.

## Lesson Goal

By the end of this page you will:

- Create a new miniCLI project.
- Run the command index.
- Understand the default project layout.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.4+
- Composer

## Step 1: Create a New App

```bash
composer create-project --prefer-dist minicli/app myapp
cd myapp
```

## Step 2: Verify the CLI boots

```bash
./minicli help
```

If this works, your command discovery and runtime are correctly wired.

## Project Structure (Typical)

```text
app/
  Commands/
  Middlewares/
  Services/
config/
  *.php
minicli
```

## Why this structure matters

- `app/Commands` is your user-facing command surface.
- `app/Middlewares` holds cross-cutting behavior.
- `app/Services` holds shared infrastructure logic.
- `config` keeps app behavior explicit and reviewable.

## Checkpoint

Before moving on, confirm:

- `./minicli help` runs with no errors.
- You can identify where your first command class should live.
