Commands return `Minicli\Console\ExitCode` so results are script-safe and explicit.

## Enum values

- `ExitCode::Success` => `0`
- `ExitCode::Failure` => `1`
- `ExitCode::Invalid` => `2`

## Typical usage

```php
return ExitCode::Success;
```

## How to think about exit codes

- Use `Success` for completed command intent.
- Use `Failure` for operational or business errors.
- Use `Invalid` for wrong invocation, unknown command path, or missing required input.
