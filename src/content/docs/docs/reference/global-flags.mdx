Global flags are available regardless of which command you run.

## `--help`

Displays help for the resolved command, including arguments and defaults.

## `--quiet`

Suppresses component output for the current command execution.

## `--profile`

Appends a profile table with command name, exit code, elapsed time, memory delta, and peak memory.

## Practical pattern

Use `--quiet` and `--profile` together when tuning commands for CI/runtime usage.
