title: Reference Overview
description: Fast lookup pages for miniCLI attributes, syntax, flags, and exit behavior.
---

This section is optimized for investigation. Use it when you already know what you are building and need exact behavior quickly.

## Core reference pages

- [Attributes](/docs/reference/attributes/)
- [Input Syntax](/docs/reference/input-syntax/)
- [Global Flags](/docs/reference/global-flags/)
- [Exit Codes](/docs/reference/exit-codes/)

## Recommended workflow

1. Start with a guided lesson when learning a concept.
2. Keep these pages open while implementing.
3. Return here when you need exact wording or behavior checks.
