Now you will create a command class and run it end to end.

## Lesson Goal

Learn the minimum contract for a working command.

## Create `app/Commands/HelloCommand.php`

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Commands;

use Minicli\Attributes\Command;
use Minicli\Components\Text;
use Minicli\Console\ConsoleCommand;
use Minicli\Console\ExitCode;

#[Command(name: 'hello', description: 'Say hello')]
final class HelloCommand extends ConsoleCommand
{
    public function __invoke(): ExitCode
    {
        Text::make('Hello from miniCLI 5.x')->success()->bold()->render();

        return ExitCode::Success;
    }
}
```

## Run it

```bash
./minicli hello
```

## What just happened

- `#[Command(...)]` made the class discoverable as a CLI command.
- Extending `ConsoleCommand` gives access to command runtime context.
- Returning `ExitCode` makes success/failure explicit and script-friendly.

## Checkpoint

Before moving on, confirm:

- The command appears in `./minicli help`.
- Running `./minicli hello` prints output and exits successfully.
