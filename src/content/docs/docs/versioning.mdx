Versioning is how you ship new releases without forcing all readers onto the latest behavior immediately.

## Route model

- Current docs live under `/docs`.
- Archived docs live under `/docs/v5`, `/docs/v6`, etc.
- Readers can switch major branches by navigating directly to the version path.

## Release workflow

When releasing a new major version:

1. Snapshot current docs into a versioned folder (for example `/docs/v5`).
2. Update navigation/version selector links.
3. Continue active docs under `/docs`.

## Suggested checklist

- Freeze old branch docs for historical accuracy.
- Mark new behavior clearly in current docs.
- Keep migration guidance visible between versions.

## Example structure

```text
src/content/docs/
  docs/
    index.mdx
    getting-started.mdx
    v5/
      index.mdx
```

## Graduation

At this point you have completed the guided path.

Use the Reference section for day-to-day lookups:

- [Reference Overview](/docs/reference/)

Need historical context?

- [Browse miniCLI 5.x docs](/docs/v5/)
