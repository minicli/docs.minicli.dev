description: Understand the core ideas that keep a miniCLI app maintainable as it grows.

This section explains the architectural model behind miniCLI. If you understand these concepts first, implementation details become easier to reason about.

## How to read this section

Follow these pages in order for a coherent mental model:

1. [Command Model](/docs/command-model/)
2. [Arguments and Flags](/docs/arguments-and-flags/)
3. [Middleware](/docs/middleware/)
4. [Services and Config](/docs/services-and-config/)

## What you should learn here

- How command paths are discovered and resolved.
- How input contracts map from CLI syntax to typed PHP method signatures.
- How middleware wraps command execution for cross-cutting concerns.
- How services and config keep command classes focused and explicit.
