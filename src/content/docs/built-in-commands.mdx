miniCLI ships with commands that accelerate development and reduce boilerplate.

## Lesson Goal

Know which built-ins to use during daily development.

## `help`

Lists available commands and subcommands.

```bash
./minicli help
```

Use this as your first health check when command discovery seems wrong.

## `discovery`

Manage command discovery cache.

```bash
./minicli discovery cache
./minicli discovery clear
```

Use this when you add/remove commands and need to control cache behavior explicitly.

## `make`

Generate boilerplate classes quickly.

```bash
./minicli make command name=create-user
./minicli make config name=api-client
./minicli make service name=user-notifier
./minicli make middleware name=auth-guard
```

Use generators to keep naming and folder conventions consistent.

## Checkpoint

Before moving on, confirm:

- You can scaffold a command and run it.
- You know when to clear or regenerate discovery cache.

## Next lesson

Use [Reference Overview](/reference/) as your lookup toolkit, then finish with [Versioning](/versioning/).
