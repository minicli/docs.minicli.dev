Versioning is how you ship new releases without forcing all readers onto the latest behavior immediately.

## Route model

- Current docs live under `/`.
- Archived docs live under `/v5`, `/v6`, etc.
- Readers can switch major branches by navigating directly to the version path.

## Release workflow

When releasing a new major version:

1. Snapshot current docs into a versioned folder (for example `/v5`).
2. Update navigation/version selector links.
3. Continue active docs under `/`.

## Suggested checklist

- Freeze old branch docs for historical accuracy.
- Mark new behavior clearly in current docs.
- Keep migration guidance visible between versions.

## Example structure

```text
src/content/docs/
  index.mdx
  getting-started.mdx
  v5/
    index.mdx
```

## Graduation

At this point you have completed the guided path.

Use the Reference section for day-to-day lookups:

- [Reference Overview](/reference/)

Need historical context?

- [Browse miniCLI 5.x docs](/v5/)
