Good CLI UX is not just about logic, it is about clarity under pressure.

## Lesson Goal

Use components to make command output and input clear, consistent, and maintainable.

## Output components

Common output components:

- `Text`
- `Alert`
- `Divider`
- `Table`
- `List\\ItemList`
- `ProgressBar`

Example:

```php
use Minicli\Components\Alert;
use Minicli\Components\Text;

Text::make('Deploy started')->info()->bold()->render();
Alert::make('Using production credentials')->warning()->render();
```

## Input components

Interactive input components:

- `Question`
- `Password`
- `Confirm`
- `Select`
- `MultiSelect`
- `Number`

Example:

```php
$env = Select::make('Select environment')
    ->options(['dev' => 'Development', 'prod' => 'Production'])
    ->ask();
```

## Quiet mode behavior

When `--quiet` is passed, component rendering is suppressed.

This is important when your CLI runs in automation contexts.

## Design tip

Treat output as a contract:

- Humans need clarity.
- Automation needs consistency.

Use style and structure intentionally.

## Checkpoint

Before moving on, confirm:

- You can choose the right output component for status vs warnings.
- You can explain why `--quiet` matters in CI pipelines.
